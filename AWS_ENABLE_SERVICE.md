# Setting Up the Microservice for Multi-Tenant Domain Redirects on AWS

To ensure requests to tenant domains pass through your microservice for handling redirects, follow the steps below:

---

## 1. Configure the Tenant's Domain

- **Domain Delegation**:
  - Configure the tenant’s DNS settings:
    - Update the **A record** to point to your microservice’s public IP (via an AWS Elastic Load Balancer).
    - Use a **CNAME record** to alias the tenant’s domain to a domain managed by your service.

---

## 2. Use AWS API Gateway or Elastic Load Balancer

- **API Gateway**:
  - Create an **API Gateway** with a custom domain name for each tenant or a wildcard domain (e.g., `*.example.com`).
  - Route incoming requests to your microservice backend.

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:
  - Deploy an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in front of your microservice.
  - Configure **host-based routing** in the ALB to distinguish between tenant domains.
  - Attach an **SSL certificate** to the ALB using **AWS Certificate Manager** for HTTPS.

---

## 3. Configure Multi-Tenant Support in the Microservice

- **Domain Detection**:
  - Inspect the `Host` header in incoming requests to identify the tenant's domain.
  - Map the domain to tenant-specific redirect rules in the database.

- **Rule Processing**:
  - Fetch and apply the tenant-specific redirect rules (e.g., regex patterns, target URLs) dynamically.

---

## 4. Handle Redirects Efficiently

- **Caching**:
  - Use **AWS ElastiCache (Redis)** to cache frequently accessed redirect rules.
  - Reduce database query frequency by storing processed redirect rules in memory.

- **HTTP Redirects**:
  - Send HTTP 301 (permanent) or 302 (temporary) status codes to perform redirects dynamically.

---

## 5. Security and Compliance

- **SSL/TLS**:
  - Manage SSL certificates with **AWS Certificate Manager**.
  - Enforce HTTPS by redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS.

- **Input Validation**:
  - Sanitize and validate regex patterns provided by tenants to prevent abuse, such as ReDoS attacks.

- **Cross-Tenant Isolation**:
  - Ensure tenant rules are isolated using namespaces or unique tenant identifiers in the database and cache.

---

## 6. Scalability

- **Auto-Scaling**:
  - Deploy the microservice on **AWS ECS** or **EKS** with auto-scaling enabled.
  - Alternatively, use **AWS Lambda** for a serverless solution to handle redirects.

- **Global Distribution**:
  - Integrate **Amazon CloudFront** as a CDN to cache redirect rules and improve latency for global users.

---

## 7. Logging and Monitoring

- **Request Tracking**:
  - Log all incoming requests and redirect actions in **Amazon CloudWatch** for debugging and auditing.

- **Monitoring Metrics**:
  - Monitor request volume, latency, and errors for each tenant using CloudWatch.
  - Set up alarms for unusual activity like high error rates or traffic spikes.

---

## 8. Deployment

- **Infrastructure as Code**:
  - Use **AWS CloudFormation** or **Terraform** to define and deploy the microservice and its infrastructure.
  - Include configurations for API Gateway, ALB, CloudFront, and DNS records.

- **CI/CD**:
  - Automate deployment pipelines with **AWS CodePipeline** or GitHub Actions for seamless updates.

---

## Example Workflow

1. The tenant points their domain to your ALB or API Gateway.
2. The ALB or API Gateway routes incoming requests to your microservice.
3. The microservice identifies the tenant by inspecting the `Host` header.
4. The microservice fetches tenant-specific redirect rules from the database (or Redis cache).
5. The microservice processes the redirect and responds with the appropriate HTTP 301/302 status code.

---

## Optional Enhancements

- **Custom Subdomains**:
  - Support subdomains (e.g., `tenant1.example.com`) for tenants and route requests accordingly.

- **Tenant Isolation**:
  - Deploy dedicated microservices for high-traffic tenants to ensure consistent performance.

---

By following these steps, your microservice will be able to efficiently handle redirects for tenant domains while maintaining scalability, security, and performance.
