# Questions for Client: URL Rewrite Module for Multi-Tenant E-Commerce

To ensure the successful delivery of the project, here are the key questions to ask the client:

---

## General Clarifications

1. **Scope Confirmation**:
   - Are there any specific features or requirements not mentioned in the document that should be included?
   - Should this module support any specific Salesforce Commerce Cloud environments or configurations?

2. **Project Goals**:
   - What is the primary purpose of this module? Is it focused on SEO, performance optimization, or managing business-level changes (like marketing campaigns)?

3. **Timeline and Deadlines**:
   - Are there specific milestones or deadlines for delivery?
   - Should the implementation be delivered in stages (e.g., admin interface first, then backend integrations)?

## Admin Interface

4. **Business Manager UI Details**:
   - Should the design of the admin interface adhere to a specific branding guideline or UI framework?
   - Are there any restrictions or preferences for third-party dependencies in the Next.js application?

5. **Bulk Import/Export**:
   - What is the expected size and complexity of CSV files for bulk import/export?
   - Should there be validation rules for CSV inputs (e.g., size limits, required columns)?

6. **Localization Support**:
   - Are there predefined locales that need to be supported, or should the system dynamically accommodate new ones?

---

## Backend and Database

7. **MongoDB Setup**:
   - Will you provide the MongoDB instance, or should we set up and manage it?
   - What level of redundancy or scaling is expected for the database?

8. **Rule Fields**:
   - Are there additional fields needed for redirect rules beyond those specified (e.g., custom metadata)?

---

## Performance and Security

9. **Caching**:
   - Should the caching system (Redis) be shared with other applications, or is it dedicated to this module?
   - How long should redirect rules be cached before revalidation?

10. **Security**:
    - Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS)?
    - Should the regex input validation block potentially malicious patterns (e.g., overly complex expressions)?

---

## Integration and Deployment

11. **CDN Integration**:
    - Which CDN(s) are currently in use (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai)?
    - Are there any existing CDN rules that the module must respect or override?

12. **Salesforce Commerce Cloud**:
    - Are there any pre-existing modules or middleware that this solution needs to integrate with?
    - Should this module handle any additional SFCC-specific configurations?

13. **Deployment**:
    - Will the module be deployed on an existing infrastructure, or should deployment infrastructure (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) be provided?
    - Are there specific environments (e.g., staging, production) where the solution needs to be tested?

---

## Logging and Analytics

14. **Log Management**:
    - Should logs be integrated with existing logging systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, CloudWatch)?
    - How long should logs be retained, and is there a need for log rotation or archiving?

15. **Analytics Requirements**:
    - What metrics are important to track (e.g., redirect frequency, performance, user behavior)?
    - Should the system support custom analytics dashboards or integrate with an external tool?

---

## Testing and Validation

16. **Quality Assurance**:
    - Are there specific test cases or scenarios you want to ensure are covered?
    - What level of testing is expected (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)?

17. **Regex Testing**:
    - Should the system include a test tool in the admin interface for users to validate their regex patterns?

---

## Future Enhancements

18. **Scalability**:
    - Should the system support adding multiple tenants/sites in the future?
    - Is there a target for the number of redirect rules the system should handle at scale?

19. **Additional Features**:
    - Are there plans to add functionality like conditional redirects (e.g., based on user-agent or geolocation)?

---

These questions will ensure clarity on the project’s vision, technical constraints, and expectations, helping deliver a solution that meets the client’s needs.
